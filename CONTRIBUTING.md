# Contributing to Awesome VueFolio

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

##  Submission Guidelines

To keep this list high-quality, please follow these rules:

1.  **Vue Ecosystem:** Projects must be built primarily with **Vue.js** (v2/v3), **Nuxt**, or **Vite**.
2.  **Open Source:** The repository must be public.
3.  **Live Demo (Preferred):** For personal portfolios, a link to the live site in the description or repo details is highly recommended.
4.  **No Tables:** We use a list format, not tables, to ensure better mobile readability and fewer merge conflicts.

##  How to Add Your Project

1.  **Search** the `README.md` to ensure your project isn't already listed.
2.  **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`.
3.  Add your link to the appropriate category in **alphabetical order**:
    - `Templates & Starters`: If your repo is meant for others to copy/fork.
    - `Personal Portfolios`: If it's your own website.
    - `Creative & Unique`: If it simulates an OS, game, or non-standard UI.
4.  **Format:** Use the following format:
    ```markdown
    - [Project Name](GitHub URL) - Description highlighting the stack (e.g., Nuxt, Tailwind).
    ```
5.  **Commit** your changes and open a **Pull Request**.

### Example

```markdown
- [My-Cool-Portfolio](https://github.com/username/repo) - A minimalist dark-mode portfolio built with **Nuxt 3** and **UnoCSS**.
